# Canonical Product-First Sub-Company Template

**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date: 2025**  
**Status: Default Structure**

---

## 1. Purpose of the Canonical Template

The canonical template exists to provide a structural foundation that ensures all product-first sub-companies under Axiom Group operate with consistent information architecture and content organization. This template reduces ambiguity in structural decisions without constraining creative or domain-specific expression within established boundaries.

The template serves three primary functions:

First, it establishes a minimum viable structure that guarantees all sub-companies communicate essential information in predictable locations. This predictability enables users, partners, and stakeholders to navigate any Axiom Group sub-company with confidence, knowing where to find specific types of information.

Second, it eliminates structural decision-making overhead for sub-companies. By providing a default structure, the template allows sub-companies to focus on domain-specific content and capabilities rather than architectural questions that have already been resolved.

Third, it ensures long-term coherence across the ecosystem. As sub-companies evolve, the canonical structure provides a stable foundation that maintains consistency even as individual implementations change.

The template prioritizes repeatability and long-term coherence over short-term optimization or trend-driven structural choices. Sub-companies that require structural deviations must provide explicit architectural justification demonstrating that the deviation serves a domain-specific requirement that cannot be met within the canonical structure.

This template does not reduce creativity but channels it into appropriate areas. Creativity is encouraged in domain-specific content, product capabilities, and technical implementation, but structural decisions must follow the canonical template unless deviation is architecturally justified.

The homepage must clearly define the system in terms of its structure, function, and capabilities. The system must be presented as infrastructure that serves a specific purpose within its domain.

**Capability Description:**
The homepage must describe what the system can do in factual, technical terms. Capabilities must be presented as system functions, not as benefits or outcomes.

**Operational Explanation:**
The homepage must explain how the system operates, how it is accessed, and how it integrates with other systems or workflows. This explanation must be technical and precise.

**Domain Relationship:**
The homepage must explain the system's relationship to its domain, its role within that domain, and how it addresses domain-specific requirements.

### 3.2 What the Homepage Focuses On

The homepage must focus on capability and structure, not benefits or outcomes.

**Capability Focus:**
The homepage must emphasize what the system can do, how it functions, and what it enables. Capabilities must be presented factually, without exaggeration or marketing language.

**Marketing Language:**
Any language designed to persuade, convince, or sell is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to: benefit statements, outcome promises, value propositions, and persuasive copy.

## 4. Product / System Page Rules

The product or system page must present the core offering as infrastructure, not as a feature bundle or product catalog.

### 4.1 Product as System

The product or system must be presented as a coherent system with architecture, not as a collection of features or capabilities.

**Architectural Presentation:**
The system must be explained in terms of its architecture, its components, and how those components interact. The architecture must be presented clearly and precisely.

**Systemic Thinking:**
The system must be presented as a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Individual features or capabilities must be explained in terms of their role within the system, not as standalone selling points.

**Infrastructure Framing:**
The system must be framed as infrastructure that enables specific functions or capabilities, not as a product that delivers benefits or outcomes.

### 4.2 Architecture and Intent Over Surface Detail

The product or system page must prioritize architectural explanation over surface-level feature descriptions.

**Architectural Explanation:**
The page must explain how the system is structured, why it is structured that way, and how the structure enables the system's function. This explanation must be technical and precise.

**Intent Communication:**
The page must communicate the system's design intent, its operational principles, and the thinking that guided its development. This communication must be institutional and principled.

**Surface Detail Minimization:**
Surface-level features, UI elements, or visual details must be minimized. When surface details are necessary, they must be explained in terms of their role within the system architecture.

### 4.4 AI-Specific Rules

If the product or system incorporates AI capabilities, the following additional rules apply:

**AI as Embedded Infrastructure:**
AI capabilities must be presented as embedded infrastructure within the system, not as separate features or selling points. AI must be explained in terms of system function, not AI capability.

**No Agent Personalities:**
If the system includes agentic behavior, agents must not be given personalities, names, or anthropomorphic characteristics. Agents must be presented as system components, not as characters or companions.

**No Capability Showcasing:**
AI capabilities must not be showcased, demonstrated, or highlighted for their own sake. AI capabilities must be explained only when necessary to understand system function.

**No "AI-Powered" Positioning:**
The system must not be positioned as "AI-powered," "intelligent," or "smart" unless such positioning is technically required for integration or operation. AI must be treated as a technical implementation detail, not as a marketing differentiator.

**Functional Explanation:**
When AI capabilities are explained, they must be explained in terms of system function, not in terms of AI capability or novelty. The explanation must focus on what the system does, not on how AI enables it.

## 8. What This Template Does Not Do

This template defines structural requirements only. It does not define other aspects of sub-company implementation.

### 8.1 Does Not Define UI Design

This template does not specify visual design, UI components, or interface elements. UI design must follow the design system and inheritance constitution, but this template does not address visual design decisions.

**Visual Independence:**
Sub-companies maintain visual independence within the constraints of the inheritance constitution. This template does not constrain visual expression beyond those constraints.

**Component Implementation:**
This template does not specify how pages are implemented using UI components. Component choices and implementations are separate from structural requirements.

**Branding:**
This template does not define branding, visual identity, or brand expression. Branding decisions are separate from structural requirements.

### 8.2 Does Not Define Branding

This template does not specify branding, visual identity, or brand expression. Branding must comply with inheritance constitution requirements, but this template does not address branding decisions.

**Brand Independence:**
Sub-companies maintain brand independence within inheritance constraints. This template does not constrain brand expression beyond those constraints.

**Visual Identity:**
This template does not specify logos, color palettes, typography choices, or other visual identity elements. These decisions are separate from structural requirements.

### 8.3 Does Not Optimize for Growth

This template does not include growth optimization, conversion optimization, or engagement techniques. The template prioritizes clarity and coherence over growth metrics.

**No Growth Hacks:**
This template does not include patterns designed to drive growth, increase engagement, or optimize conversions. Such patterns are forbidden by the inheritance constitution.

**No Metrics Optimization:**
This template does not optimize for any metrics, analytics, or measurement goals. The template prioritizes structural clarity and information architecture.

### 8.4 Does Not Replace Product Thinking

This template provides structural requirements but does not replace product thinking, domain expertise, or technical decision-making.

**Product Decisions:**
This template does not specify what products to build, what features to include, or what capabilities to provide. These decisions remain the responsibility of the sub-company.

**Domain Expertise:**
This template does not replace domain expertise or technical knowledge. Sub-companies must still make domain-specific and technical decisions within the structural framework.

**Architectural Justification:**
When sub-companies require structural deviations, they must provide architectural justification. This template does not eliminate the need for thoughtful architectural decision-making.

---

## Template Status

This template is the default structure for all product-first sub-companies under Axiom Group. Deviations require explicit architectural justification demonstrating that the deviation serves a domain-specific requirement that cannot be met within the canonical structure.

All sub-companies must implement this template from launch. Existing sub-companies that do not comply must come into compliance or be removed from the ecosystem.
