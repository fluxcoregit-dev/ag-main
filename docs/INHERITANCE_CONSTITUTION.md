# Axiom Group Inheritance Constitution

**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date: 2025**  
**Status: Immutable**

---

## 1. Purpose of the Inheritance System

The inheritance system exists to ensure long-term coherence across all ventures operating under Axiom Group. This system is not a mechanism of control but a framework for maintaining consistency in philosophy, interaction patterns, and structural principles.

Inheritance serves three primary functions:

First, it preserves the foundational principles that define Axiom Group's approach to building systems. These principles are not negotiable because they represent the core architectural thinking that enables the ecosystem to function as a coherent whole.

Second, it establishes a common language of interaction and expression that allows users, partners, and stakeholders to recognize and navigate Axiom Group ventures with confidence. This recognition is not about branding but about predictable, reliable interaction patterns.

Third, it ensures that short-term optimization or trend-driven decisions do not compromise the long-term value and coherence of the ecosystem. Inheritance creates constraints that prevent ventures from making decisions that, while individually rational, collectively degrade the system.

The inheritance system prioritizes long-term consistency over speed of execution. Ventures that cannot operate within these constraints are not suitable for the Axiom Group ecosystem, regardless of their individual merit or potential.

## 2. Immutable Layers

The following layers must be inherited by all sub-companies without modification. These rules cannot be changed, adapted, or negotiated by any venture operating under Axiom Group.

### 2.1 Philosophical Principles

All sub-companies must operate under the following philosophical principles:

**Stillness by Default**
Interfaces must be visually calm in their default state. Motion, animation, and visual change must only occur in response to explicit user intent. Auto-playing animations, scroll-triggered animations, and decorative motion are forbidden.

**Response on Intent**
All interactive feedback must be triggered by user action. Hover states, focus states, and active states are permitted. Passive animations, ambient effects, and system-initiated visual changes are forbidden.

**Light as Feedback**
Visual emphasis must serve functional purposes. Accent colors, glows, and highlights must indicate interactivity, state changes, or important information. Decorative use of light, color, or visual effects is forbidden.

**Systems Over Features**
All design and development decisions must prioritize systemic thinking over feature-level optimization. Solutions that work for a single product but cannot scale across the ecosystem are forbidden.

**Long-Term Orientation**
All decisions must be evaluated against multi-year time horizons. Short-term optimizations that compromise long-term maintainability, coherence, or value are forbidden.

### 2.2 Interaction Philosophy

All sub-companies must adhere to the following interaction principles:

**Keyboard Accessibility**
All interactive elements must be fully accessible via keyboard navigation. Focus states must be visible and clearly indicated. Tab order must be logical and predictable.

**Semantic HTML**
All content must use appropriate semantic HTML elements. Headings must follow proper hierarchy. Landmarks must be correctly implemented. ARIA attributes must be used only when semantic HTML is insufficient.

**No Motion Without Intent**
Motion must only occur in response to user action. State transitions are permitted. Loading indicators are permitted. Decorative animations are forbidden.

**Predictable Feedback**
All interactive elements must provide clear, immediate feedback on user action. Feedback must be consistent across similar interaction patterns. Unexpected or delayed feedback is forbidden.

**No Proximity Effects**
Interactive elements must not respond to cursor proximity without explicit user action. Hover effects are permitted only on the element being hovered. Cursor tracking, parallax effects, and proximity-based animations are forbidden.

### 2.3 Structural Layout Rules

All sub-companies must follow these structural requirements:

**Left Alignment**
Primary content must be left-aligned, not centered. Headlines, body text, and primary content areas must align to the left edge. Centered alignment is permitted only for specific, justified use cases such as short quotes or call-to-action buttons.

**Max-Width Constraints**
Content areas must not exceed 800 pixels in width for primary text content. Grid layouts may expand to 1200 pixels for multi-column content. Full-width layouts are forbidden except for structural elements such as headers and footers.

**Spacing Rhythm**
Vertical spacing must use the established token system. Section spacing must follow the defined scale. Internal component spacing must follow the defined scale. Arbitrary spacing values are forbidden.

**Container Structure**
All content must be contained within the standard container component. Containers must center content horizontally with consistent padding. Custom container implementations are forbidden.

**Section Hierarchy**
Content must be organized into sections using the standard section component. Sections must use appropriate spacing tokens. Sections must not overlap or create visual conflicts.

### 2.4 Language & Tone Rules

All sub-companies must adhere to the following language requirements:

**Institutional Tone**
All written content must use calm, declarative language. Marketing language, urgency language, and persuasive copy are forbidden. Content must read like internal institutional documentation, not marketing materials.

**Precise Language**
All descriptions must be precise and factual. Vague claims, superlatives, and unsubstantiated statements are forbidden. Technical descriptions must be accurate and verifiable.

**No Trend References**
Content must not reference current trends, popular culture, or time-bound concepts. Language must remain relevant for 10-20 years. References to specific technologies, platforms, or cultural moments are forbidden unless they are foundational and permanent.

**No Storytelling**
Content must not include founder stories, company histories, timelines, or narrative elements. Focus must be on principles, systems, and capabilities, not on people or events.

**No Achievement Language**
Content must not highlight achievements, milestones, awards, or recognition. Focus must be on capabilities and principles, not on past accomplishments.

**No Urgency Language**
Content must not use urgency language such as "now," "limited time," "act fast," or similar phrases. All language must be calm and timeless.

## 3. Mutable Layers

The following layers may be adapted by sub-companies within strict boundaries. Adaptation must be justified by domain-specific requirements and must not violate immutable layers.

### 3.1 Accent Color Usage

Sub-companies may select a single accent color that differs from the Axiom Group accent, provided the following constraints are met:

**Single Accent Only**
Only one accent color may be used. Multiple accent colors are forbidden.

**Muted Tone Required**
The accent color must be muted and sophisticated. Bright, saturated, or attention-grabbing colors are forbidden. The accent must maintain the restrained aesthetic of the design system.

**Usage Restrictions**
The accent color may only be used for:
- Call-to-action buttons and links
- Focus indicators
- Strategic dividers (not all dividers)
- Critical state indicators

The accent color may not be used for:
- Decorative elements
- Background colors
- Text colors (except in buttons)
- Icons or illustrations

**Approval Required**
Any accent color selection must be approved by Axiom Group before implementation. Approval will be based on adherence to muted tone requirements and appropriate usage restrictions.

### 3.2 Domain-Specific UI Density

Sub-companies may adjust UI density to accommodate domain-specific requirements, provided the following constraints are met:

**Spacing Scale Preservation**
All spacing must use the established token system. Custom spacing values are forbidden. Density adjustments must be achieved through selection of appropriate tokens, not through arbitrary values.

**Readability Maintenance**
Density adjustments must not compromise readability. Text must maintain minimum line height and spacing requirements. Content must remain scannable and accessible.

**Consistency Within Domain**
Density adjustments must be consistent across the entire sub-company interface. Mixed density patterns are forbidden.

**Justification Required**
Density adjustments must be justified by domain-specific requirements. Documentation must explain why standard density is insufficient for the domain.

### 3.3 Product-Specific Components

Sub-companies may create product-specific components, provided the following constraints are met:

**Primitive Foundation**
All product-specific components must be built using existing primitives. New primitive-level components are forbidden.

**Token Compliance**
All product-specific components must use design tokens exclusively. Hardcoded colors, spacing, or typography values are forbidden.

**No New Patterns**
Product-specific components must not introduce new interaction patterns. All interactions must follow established patterns from the design system.

**Documentation Required**
All product-specific components must be documented with:
- Purpose and use case
- Token usage
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility considerations

**Approval Required**
Product-specific components that deviate significantly from established patterns must be approved by Axiom Group before implementation.

## 5. AI-First Venture Constraints

Sub-companies that are AI-first or AI-native must adhere to additional constraints beyond the standard inheritance requirements.

### 5.1 AI as Infrastructure

AI capabilities must be treated as infrastructure, not as features or products. AI must operate quietly in the background, enabling functionality rather than demanding attention.

**No AI Branding**
AI capabilities must not be branded, named, or highlighted as AI features. References to "AI-powered," "intelligent," or "smart" are forbidden unless they are necessary for technical accuracy.

**No AI Spectacle**
AI capabilities must not be presented as impressive, novel, or remarkable. Demonstrations of AI capability for the sake of demonstration are forbidden.

**Embedded Operation**
AI must be embedded within systems, not presented as separate features. Users should experience AI through improved functionality, not through explicit AI interactions.

### 5.2 Agent Behavior

If a sub-company implements agentic behavior, the following constraints apply:

**Predictable Operation**
Agent behavior must be predictable and explainable. Agents must operate within clearly defined boundaries. Unexpected or surprising agent behavior is forbidden.

**User Control**
Users must maintain control over agent behavior. Agents must not act autonomously without user consent. Agents must provide clear feedback about their actions and intentions.

**Transparency**
Agent decision-making must be transparent. Users must understand why agents make specific decisions. Black-box agent behavior is forbidden.

**No Capability Showcasing**
AI capabilities must not be showcased or demonstrated for their own sake. Capabilities must be presented only when they directly serve user needs.

**Consistent Behavior**
AI behavior must be consistent across interactions. Variable or unpredictable AI responses are forbidden unless variation serves a clear functional purpose.

**Error Handling**
AI errors must be handled gracefully and transparently. Users must understand when AI has failed and must have clear paths to resolution. Hiding AI failures or errors is forbidden.

**No Anthropomorphism**
AI must not be presented as human-like. Anthropomorphic language, personalities, or representations are forbidden. AI must be presented as a tool, not as a companion or character.

### 6.1 Visual Relationship

Sub-companies must maintain visual independence while acknowledging their relationship to Axiom Group.

**No Co-Branding**
Sub-companies must not co-brand with Axiom Group. Logos must not be combined. Brand elements must not be mixed. Visual association must be subtle and minimal.

**Discrete Presence**
Axiom Group must be referenced discretely, typically in footer areas or about sections. Axiom Group must not dominate sub-company visual identity.

**Approval Required**
All sub-company names must be approved by Axiom Group before use. Approval will be based on distinctiveness, appropriateness, and alignment with Axiom Group principles.

### 6.3 Disclosure Placement

Sub-companies must disclose their relationship to Axiom Group in specific locations.

**Footer Disclosure**
All sub-companies must include a discrete disclosure in the footer indicating their relationship to Axiom Group. The disclosure must be factual and minimal.

**About Section Disclosure**
Sub-companies may include additional disclosure in about sections, but such disclosure must be factual and non-promotional.

**No Promotional Use**
The Axiom Group relationship must not be used for promotional purposes. References must be factual and institutional, not marketing-oriented.

### 6.4 Prohibition of Co-Branding Theatrics

## 7. Enforcement Principle

The inheritance system is not optional. Violations of immutable layers result in immediate disqualification from the Axiom Group ecosystem.

### 7.1 Violation Evaluation

Violations are evaluated based on alignment with philosophical principles, not on technical implementation details. A venture that implements all technical requirements but violates philosophical principles is in violation.

**Philosophical Alignment**
The primary evaluation criterion is philosophical alignment. Ventures must demonstrate understanding and commitment to Axiom Group principles, not just technical compliance.

**Systemic Thinking**
Ventures must demonstrate systemic thinking in all decisions. Feature-level optimization that ignores systemic implications is a violation.

**Long-Term Orientation**
Ventures must demonstrate long-term orientation in all decisions. Short-term optimizations that compromise long-term value are violations.

### 7.2 Disqualification Criteria

Ventures are disqualified from the Axiom Group ecosystem if they:

**Violate Immutable Layers**
Any violation of immutable layers results in immediate disqualification. There are no exceptions or negotiations.

**Demonstrate Philosophical Misalignment**
Ventures that demonstrate fundamental misalignment with Axiom Group principles are disqualified, regardless of technical compliance.

**Refuse Inheritance**
Ventures that refuse to inherit required layers or attempt to negotiate immutable requirements are disqualified.

**Repeated Violations**
Ventures that repeatedly violate mutable layer constraints or demonstrate inability to operate within boundaries are disqualified.

### 7.3 Inheritance as Requirement

Inheritance is not optional. All ventures operating under Axiom Group must fully inherit immutable layers and operate within mutable layer boundaries.

**No Partial Inheritance**
Ventures cannot selectively inherit layers. All immutable layers must be inherited completely.

**No Negotiation**
Immutable layers are not negotiable. Ventures cannot request exceptions or modifications to immutable requirements.

**No Grandfathering**
Existing ventures that do not comply with inheritance requirements must come into compliance or be removed from the ecosystem. There are no grandfather clauses.

### 7.4 Continuous Compliance

Compliance is not a one-time requirement but a continuous obligation.

**Ongoing Evaluation**
Ventures are continuously evaluated for compliance. Compliance at launch does not guarantee ongoing compliance.

**Evolution Requirements**
As ventures evolve, all changes must maintain compliance with inheritance requirements. New features, redesigns, or pivots must not violate inheritance constraints.

**Removal Process**
Ventures that fail to maintain compliance will be removed from the Axiom Group ecosystem. Removal is immediate and non-negotiable.
