## 3. Product / System Framing

### 3.1 System as Infrastructure

System Protocol is presented as infrastructure that enables coordination, not as a product that delivers benefits or outcomes.

**Infrastructure Framing:**
The system is explained as protocol infrastructure that other systems use to coordinate. It is presented as a foundational layer, not as an application or product.

**Architectural Presentation:**
The system is explained in terms of its architecture: how protocols are structured, how coordination patterns are defined, how autonomous systems interact through the infrastructure. The architecture is presented clearly and precisely.

**Systemic Thinking:**
The system is presented as a coherent whole that enables distributed coordination. Individual protocol elements or coordination patterns are explained in terms of their role within the system, not as standalone features.

### 3.2 AI Embedded Quietly

AI capabilities are embedded within System Protocol as infrastructure, not presented as features or selling points.

**Infrastructure Treatment:**
AI is treated as a technical implementation detail within the coordination protocols. AI capabilities enable protocol functions but are not highlighted or showcased.

**Embedded Operation:**
AI operates quietly in the background, enabling coordination patterns and autonomous decision-making without demanding attention. Users experience AI through improved coordination capabilities, not through explicit AI interactions.

**No AI Branding:**
The system is not branded as "AI-powered" or "intelligent." AI is not mentioned unless technically necessary for understanding protocol operation or integration requirements.

**Functional Explanation:**
When AI capabilities are explained, they are explained in terms of system function: how protocols enable coordination, how autonomous systems make decisions, how distributed systems maintain coherence. The explanation focuses on what the system does, not on how AI enables it.

### 3.3 Agent Behavior Without Anthropomorphism

If System Protocol includes agentic behavior, agents are presented as system components, not as characters or companions.

**System Component Framing:**
Agents are explained as components within the coordination infrastructure that execute protocol functions. They are presented as technical elements, not as personalities or characters.

**Predictable Operation:**
Agent behavior is explained as predictable and rule-based. Agents operate within clearly defined boundaries and follow established protocols. Their behavior is transparent and explainable.

**No Personality:**
Agents are not given names, personalities, or anthropomorphic characteristics. They are referred to by their function within the system, not as entities with identity.

**Control and Transparency:**
Agent behavior is explained in terms of user control and system transparency. Users understand how agents operate, what decisions they make, and how to control their behavior.

**Restraint:**
Agents operate with restraint. They do not initiate interactions unnecessarily, do not seek attention, and do not demonstrate capabilities for their own sake. Agents wait for system requirements before acting.

### 3.4 Predictability, Control, and Restraint

System Protocol emphasizes predictability, user control, and operational restraint.

**Predictable Operation:**
The system operates predictably. Protocol behavior is consistent, coordination patterns are reliable, and autonomous decisions follow established rules. Users can understand and predict system behavior.

**User Control:**
Users maintain control over system operation. Protocols can be configured, coordination patterns can be adjusted, and autonomous behavior can be constrained. The system does not act autonomously without user consent or configuration.

**Operational Restraint:**
The system operates with restraint. It does not seek attention, does not showcase capabilities, and does not initiate interactions unnecessarily. The system waits for requirements and responds appropriately.
